Bike Brigade is a community-driven initiative dedicated to
facilitating the transportation of essential items, such as food
donations, from one location to another within our community.

Using bicycles for deliveries, our aim is twofold: to foster a
stronger sense of community care and support existing local groups,
while simultaneously reducing our city's carbon footprint. Itâ€™s a
sustainable and compassionate action.

Solidarity, not charity.
