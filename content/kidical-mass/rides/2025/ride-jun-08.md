**Ride starts at:** [Gaetz Brook Junior High](https://maps.app.goo.gl/jmH2xL5UYDpbWBFG6)

In rural parts of Halifax, like the Eastern Shore, trails are an important off-road option to help folks get around by bike. Well maintained and well connected trails make it possible for kids to walk and bike to school in places where there aren't sidewalks.


The [SATA Trails Society](https://satatrails.ca/strategic_plan.html) (who maintain the Gaetz Brook Greenway) are an active and engaged group of people, who want to expand the role of active transportation in their community. If the Greenway gets connected to existing and planned infrastructure, there would be a continuous bike route all the way to/from downtown Halifax.
