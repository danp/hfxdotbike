## Ride Specific Info

* Our meeting point is the front entrance of the Halifax Central Library
* The library is not open at this time, but we will have a few amusements (sidewalk chalk, bubbles) set up to help keep the kids busy before the ride. 
* There are bus stops on Spring Garden Rd near the starting point of the ride.
* There is paid parking in the parking garage attached to the Central Library (entrance on Queen St at DaCosta Row), and in the Dalhousie surface parking lot at the same entrance.
* We’ll be riding to the Halifax waterfront using a mix of roads, multi-use paths, and a bit of the waterfront boardwalk
* We’ll be travelling downhill using short stretches of Bishop St and Terminal Rd, with steep slopes. Please keep this in mind for any of your young riders.
* There are protected bike lanes on both Hollis St and Lower Water St, which you may choose to use during the ride. However, these lanes are sometimes obstructed by vehicles or debris. Due to the size of our group, we are planning to use the roadway on both Hollis and Lower Water. 
* Our destination is the Submarine playground, outside the Maritime Museum of the Atlantic.
* See the map below for more details of the route
* There are washrooms located inside the museum, and port-a-potties on the waterfront near the Salt Yard.
* We’ll have snacks and prizes at the destination, including slushies courtesy of [I Heart Bikes](https://iheartbikeshfx.com/).
* We're collaborating with Jane's Walk Halifax for this month's ride. We'll be giving away a copy of the children's book [Walking in the City with Jane](https://www.kidscanpress.com/product/walking-in-the-city-with-jane/) at the end of the ride.
