Come chat with us about biking with kids: it's a meet and greet for the Halifax family cycling community!

- Ride and chat on the oval (not yet open for the season)

- Buy/Sell/Trade kids bikes & accessories

- We'll provide coffee, hot cocoa, juice boxes and snacks

- Test-ride an e-bike from Halifax Cycles

- Have a bike checked (and minor adjustments) by the Ecology Action Centreâ€™s Pop-up Bike Hub 

- Bring a food donation for our local community fridges, and help us "stuff a bike". We'll fill the Bike Brigade cargo bike with food for those who need it.

If we need to cancel due to weather conditions, we will post a notice on this website by 12:00 noon. The rain date is Sunday April 13.

Please help protect our community from illnesses such as COVID-19. Our rides and activities take place entirely outdoors, but we share outdoor public space with many others. Mask-wearing is welcomed. Please stay home if you feel unwell or have any symptoms of illness.
