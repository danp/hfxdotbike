**Emera Oval, [5775 Cogswell St, Halifax](https://maps.app.goo.gl/KuMZB9moL91hLmkD9)**

Come chat with us about biking with kids: it’s a meet and greet for the Halifax family cycling community!

* Ride and chat on the oval (not yet open for the season)
* Buy/Sell/Trade kids bikes & accessories
* We’ll provide juice boxes and snacks
* Test-ride an e-bike from Halifax Cycles
* Have a bike checked (and minor adjustments) by the Ecology Action Centre’s Pop-up Bike Hub
* We'll have sidewalk chalk, bubbles, and colouring pages to keep the kids amused.
* Bring a food donation for our local community fridges, and help us “stuff a bike”. We’ll fill the Bike Brigade cargo bike with food for those who need it.
* If we need to cancel due to weather conditions, we will post a notice on this website by 12:00 noon. The rain date is Sunday April 13.
* Please help protect our community from illnesses such as COVID-19. Our rides and activities take place entirely outdoors, but we share outdoor public space with many others. Mask-wearing is welcomed. Please stay home if you feel unwell or have any symptoms of illness.
