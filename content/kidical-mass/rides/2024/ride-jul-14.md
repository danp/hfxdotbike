## Ride Specific Info
* Our ride starts and ends in Shubie Park. We'll meet at the Fairbanks Interpretive Centre, which is located on Locks Rd.
* There are public washrooms outside the Fairbanks Centre. 
* There are benches, picnic tables, and a grassy space for playing and gathering. 
* The nearest bus stops are on Waverley Road.
* There is parking at the Fairbanks Centre, and also at the ball field and pump track, which are accessed via John Brenton Drive.
* We'll ride on paved roads and gravel/crusher-dust pathways. The route includes some short sections with steep inclines and declines (up to 6%). 
* Some portions of the route use narrow neighbourhood walking paths, which are not accurately represented on the route map (e.g. between Michael Wallace Elementary & Andover St, and between Andover St & Angel Court). 
* Our ride is (mostly) a loop: passing by some other local parks and playgrounds, and ending at the Shubie Park Pump Track for bike & scooter skills practice.
* There is a playground at the Shubie Park Campground, 200m from the pump track and sports field. There are public washroom facilities at the campground, in addition to the ones at the Fairbanks Centre.
* Weâ€™ll provide snacks, prizes, and activities at the end of the ride.
* We encourage you to stay and enjoy the park if you can. The [Lockside Canteen](https://lemon.dog/) opens at 12:00, and you can find more information about exploring Shubie Park [here](https://www.shubenacadiecanal.ca/shubie-park).
