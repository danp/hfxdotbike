## Ride Specific Info

* Our meeting point is on Devonshire Ave at Vincent Street
* There is a triangular patch of grass where we can gather, and we'll have a few amusements (sidewalk chalk, bubbles) set up to help keep the kids busy before the ride
* There are bus stops on Barrington Street near the starting point of the ride
* There is plenty of on-street parking near the starting point of the ride
* We'll be riding to the Halifax waterfront using a mix of roads, multi-use paths, and a bit of the waterfront boardwalk
* See the map below for more details of the route
* We'll be travelling downhill on Devonshire Ave, but there is a steep slope (up to 5%) where it meets Barrington St. Please keep this in mind for any of your young riders. 
* The multi-use path conditions are rough (loose gravel and uneven paving) in a couple of spots, due to construction at the Cogswell interchange
* Our destination is the waterfront playground, outside the Maritime Museum of the Atlantic
* There are washrooms located inside the museum, and port-a-potties on the waterfront near the Salt Yard
* We'll have snacks and prizes at the destination, including popsicles from the HaliPops trike!
