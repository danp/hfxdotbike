## Ride Specific Info

* We’ll meet at the Conrose Park playground (nearest Conrose Ave and Geldert St). 
* There are bus stops nearby on Oxford St.
* There is on-street parking on several nearby streets, and a small parking lot accessed from Jubilee Road.
* The ride ends at Westmount School Playground (6700 Edward Arab Ave).
* Westmount has 3 separate playground structures, including one with wheelchair accessible features. There is also a large sports field, tennis courts, and a gagaball pit.

* See the map below for more details of the ride route. PLEASE NOTE: this route contains a relatively long incline (Beech St) and decline (Oak St) which may be challenging for the youngest of riders. 
* We’ll provide snacks, prizes, and activities at the end of the ride.
* [Halifax Cycles](https://www.halifaxcycles.com/) will join us to offer e-cargo bike test rides in the school parking lot.
