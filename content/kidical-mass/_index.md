Kidical Mass is an international movement for child- and cycling-friendly cities. Our rides are a celebration of cycling and a way to show that kids & families need safe spaces to ride in their communities.

Our rides are an opportunity for adults and children to ride together in an urban setting. Everyone is welcome, and our participants often include:
* families with grown-ups and children all on their own bikes
* grown-ups carrying children on adult bikes (e.g. with kid-seats, trail-a-bikes, trailers or cargo bikes)
* grown-ups without children


We strive to make each ride comfortable for people of all ages and abilities. Each ride is no more than a few kilometres, and is supported by community ride marshals.

## What to expect on a Kidical Mass ride
* We will meet at 9:30am and the rides will start at 10:00am
* Our rides are an opportunity for kids and their grown-ups to ride their bikes (or scooters) together, on multi-use pathways and city streets.
* Rides typically start and/or end at a playground, or other kid-friendly destination
* Rides are planned, led and marshalled by community volunteers
* Snacks and drinks are provided at the end of the ride
* Meeting places and routes will be specified for each ride, including a map and turn-by-turn directions

* If we need to cancel due to weather conditions, we will post a notice on this website by 7:30am on the day of the ride.
* Please help protect our community from COVID-19. Our rides and activities take place entirely outdoors, but we do ride as a group and share outdoor public space with many others. Masks are welcomed, but please stay home if you feel unwell.

## Feedback Survey
We want Kidical Mass to be an enjoyable event for as many people as possible. We want to know what went well and what didn’t go so well this year so that we can do better in 2024!

You can help us by filling out this [brief survey](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSePLqcruUqBEGgNmAu1tyjt8Id9Qj6CEoLDZ6nN-5bUuNZcCw/viewform). Even if you didn't attend any rides, we'd love to hear from you!

Your responses will be used to help us improve our rides for next year. We may also share some summary results with the community through social media channels, but we will not collect or share any identifying information.

We've got some great prizes for folks who complete the survey. There's an option for you to provide us with your email address at the end of the survey, on a separate form for anonymity. Please complete the survey by November 15 to be included in the prize draw!
