Kidical Mass is an international movement to create a “Kidical Mass” of families who want to enable children's independent and safe mobility. Our rides are a celebration of cycling and a way to show that we need safe spaces to ride. Each ride is no more than a few kilometres, and is supported by community ride marshals. We strive to make each ride comfortable for people of all ages and abilities. Everyone is welcome, including children on their own bikes, and people without children.
