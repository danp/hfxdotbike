Kidical Mass is an international movement for child- and cycling-friendly cities. Our rides are a celebration of cycling and a way to show that kids & families need safe spaces to ride in their communities.

Our rides are an opportunity for adults and children to ride together in an urban setting. Everyone is welcome, and our participants often include:
* families with grown-ups and children all on their own bikes
* grown-ups carrying children on adult bikes (e.g. with kid-seats, trail-a-bikes, trailers or cargo bikes)
* grown-ups without children

We strive to make each ride comfortable for people of all ages and abilities. Each ride is no more than a few kilometres, and is supported by community ride marshals.
