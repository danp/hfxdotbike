When I started as Bike Mayor of Halifax, I launched a project to get
community input about what people think the term “all abilities”
means. The term is used in the context of cycling infrastructure in
Halifax. You’ll often hear city planners and cycling advocates talk
about “all ages and abilities”. The “all ages” part is relatively
clear, but it’s never been clear whether “all abilities” refers to
cycling ability, disability, or both.

I collected data, wrote a report, and an accompanying blog post. The
[blog post](https://cyclehalifax.ca/2021/03/what-does-all-abilities-mean/)
is still available on the website of the Halifax Cycling
Coalition, but the report doesn’t seem to be any more. So, I’m hosting
the report here to make sure it continues to be available.
